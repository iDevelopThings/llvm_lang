# Architecture decision log

A dated, append-only log of real design forks in this project - the "why we
did X instead of Y" narrative that doesn't fit anywhere else: too
cross-cutting for a single code comment, not language-spec material for
`LANGUAGE.md`, and not "how to work in this repo" material for `AGENTS.md`.
Entries are never edited to look like they were always right - if a
decision is later reversed, add a new entry that supersedes the old one and
say so, rather than rewriting history.

This is a decision log, not a task tracker - see `BLOCKERS.md` for
currently-open questions still needing a human call, and `AGENTS.md` for the
pointer to all of this project's docs.

## 2026-07-22 - Numeric type widths: six concrete kinds, `int` as an alias

**Decision:** add explicit-width integers `i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`i64` and floats
`f32`/`f64`, with `int` kept as a pure alias for `i32` (not a distinct type -
`sema.TypeInt == sema.TypeI32`, literally the same `Type` value) rather than
its own 64-bit type or a separate concept entirely.

**Why:** `main`'s real LLVM signature must return `i32` (the OS process exit
code) - keeping `int == i32` means a source-level `func main() int { return
code }` needs no truncation/cast at all, since the language's own `int` and
the platform C ABI's `int` are simply the same type (see `CODEGEN.md`'s
"`int` is 32-bit" section). No unsigned types were added alongside these -
they weren't requested and bring their own complexity (comparison semantics,
printf specifiers) that's easy to layer in later if actually wanted.

**Status:** shipped. See `LANGUAGE.md`'s Types section for the full rules,
including the untyped-numeric-constant model this made necessary (six
concrete widths made bare literals like `5` ambiguous without Go's own
untyped-constant deferral/defaulting rules).

## 2026-07-22 - The arena allocator: one process-lifetime bump allocator, not scoped frees

**Decision:** every codegen-level heap allocation (currently just string
concatenation) goes through one centralized, generated LLVM function
(`llvm_lang.arena_alloc`) that bump-allocates out of malloc'd 64KiB chunks,
grown for the lifetime of the process. No `free`, no refcounting, no GC -
this is a real, intentional, permanent memory leak.

**Why:** this project doesn't have a real memory-management strategy
designed yet (scoped stack-frame frees, refcounting, a tracing GC are all
still on the table - see the open entry in `BLOCKERS.md`), and inventing one
wasn't in scope for landing string concatenation. Centralizing every
allocation behind one primitive now means whichever real strategy gets
chosen later only has one call site to change, instead of having to hunt
down and retrofit scattered ad hoc `malloc` calls across the codebase. This
is explicitly groundwork for that future decision, not an attempt to
preempt it.

**Status:** shipped, and treated as the default allocation path for any
future heap-needing feature (e.g. dynamic arrays) until the real
memory-management question is answered. See `CODEGEN.md`'s "The arena
allocator" section for the mechanics.

## 2026-07-22 - First-class functions: fat-pointer `{fnPtr, ctxPtr}` representation

**Decision:** a function value (currently: a free-function reference only)
lowers to a two-pointer LLVM struct `{ fnPtr, ctxPtr }`, not a bare function
pointer. This round, `ctxPtr` is always null and unused - only `fnPtr` does
anything. A direct call (`add(1, 2)` where `add` is a statically-known
function name) bypasses this representation entirely and stays a plain
direct `call`, zero overhead; only a call *through* a function-typed
variable goes through the fat pointer.

**Why:** the user explicitly asked that this representation account for a
future bound-method value (`p.move` referenced without being called) even
though method values are out of scope this round - a bound method value
naturally needs to carry both a function pointer *and* the receiver address
it closes over, which is exactly the `ctxPtr` slot this representation
already has room for. Choosing the fat-pointer shape now means that future
feature can slot into the same representation and calling convention
without a later redesign/migration of every existing function-value site.

**Status:** shipped. Free functions are first-class values (reference,
assign, pass, return, call indirectly); method values remain explicitly out
of scope. See `LANGUAGE.md`'s "First-class functions" section for the
language-level rules and `CODEGEN.md`'s "First-class functions" section for
the fat-pointer construction site (`genFuncValue`) and the direct-vs-
indirect call dispatch (`isDirectFuncCall`/`genIndirectCall`).

## 2026-07-22 - Multi-file packages: directory = package, non-recursive

**Decision:** a package is exactly "every `.llx` file directly inside one
directory" - Go's own model, adopted as-is rather than inventing a distinct
convention. Explicitly non-recursive: a subdirectory's `.llx` files are
never pulled in, even implicitly. `llvmc some/dir/main.llx` and
`llvmc some/dir` are defined to compile the identical file set (a file
argument resolves to its own containing directory - see `src/loader`).

**Why:** this is the one genuinely obvious choice here - Go developers
already know exactly what "package = directory, no recursion" means, and
this language is already deliberately Go-flavored throughout (`LANGUAGE.md`'s
own opening line). The alternative (an explicit file list in some manifest,
or a recursive package tree like a namespace hierarchy) would add real
design surface - manifest syntax, or nested-package name resolution - for a
problem Go already has a well-understood answer to, with no motivating
reason this project needs something different. Non-recursive specifically
avoids a subdirectory silently becoming part of a package it wasn't
obviously meant to belong to (e.g. a `testdata/`-style subfolder of sample
`.llx` files next to a real package).

**Status:** shipped. See `LANGUAGE.md`'s "Multi-file packages" section for
the full model, and this round's `examples/multifile/` for a real example.
Cross-package `import` syntax, actually acting on it, and the already-present
`sema.Symbol.Exported` hook becoming a real enforced rule are all explicitly
out of scope for this round - a single package is still the only unit that
exists right now.

## 2026-07-22 - Multi-file packages: one shared Module per package, not one Module per file

**Decision:** `codegen.GeneratePackage` lowers every file in a package into
one single `llvm.Module`, never one `llvm.Module` per file linked together
afterward.

**Why:** every file in a package always ends up needing to call into, and be
called from, every other file in that same package - there is no notion of
"this file's functions are private to it" yet (see the `Exported` entry
above - not enforced this round), so a per-file-module design would need
every cross-file call to go through an external-linkage declaration plus a
real link step (LLVM's own module linker, or an equivalent), purely to
re-assemble something that one shared module already gives for free. Since
this compiler is the only producer of every module in play - there's no
external LLVM module from some other toolchain that this needs to
interoperate with - there's no requirement to keep files as separate
compilation units at the LLVM IR level; only a *frontend* file/tree
distinction is required at all (for diagnostics, and so `ast.NodeIndex`
stays meaningful - see `sema.Symbol.Tree`'s doc comment), not a *backend*
one. One shared module is simply less machinery for a requirement (separate
files, still one compiled program) this project doesn't have.

**Status:** shipped. See `CODEGEN.md`'s "Multi-file packages: one shared
Module per package" section for the mechanics (`Generator.funcs`/`globals`/
`structLayouts` all keyed by `*sema.Symbol`/`*sema.StructInfo` pointer
identity, not `ast.NodeIndex`, which is what makes a shared module free of
extra cross-file plumbing).

## 2026-07-22 - Adopting `afero` for file loading

**Decision:** all disk I/O this compiler needs for multi-file package
loading (`src/loader`) goes through `github.com/spf13/afero`'s `afero.Fs`
interface rather than calling `os.ReadFile`/`os.ReadDir`/`os.Stat` directly.
Production wires in `afero.NewOsFs()`; tests build fake package layouts with
`afero.NewMemMapFs()`.

**Why:** `src/loader`'s own test suite needs to exercise several directory
shapes (multiple files, an empty directory, a file resolving to its
containing directory, an unreadable file) that would otherwise mean
creating and tearing down real temp directories on disk for every test case
- slower, and it leaves a real (if test-scoped) filesystem footprint that
has to be cleaned up correctly on every path, including a failing test. An
in-memory `afero.Fs` gives the exact same `Stat`/`ReadDir`/`Open`-shaped
interface this package already needs, so `Load` itself has zero knowledge of
which implementation it's handed - production and test code share the
identical code path, not a mocked variant that could drift from what
actually runs.

**Status:** shipped, and adopted as a standing convention going forward, not
just for this one package - see `AGENTS.md`'s new note under `## Standards`:
any future disk I/O this compiler needs should go through `afero.Fs` for the
same testability reason, rather than reaching for `os` directly out of
habit.
